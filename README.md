# android-nanomsg
nanomsg native library for Android

This repo uses nanomsg 0.8 with [modifications](https://github.com/litereplica/nanomsg/commit/ca661c77c320ae8c07d2824af980bb34244403e6) required to compile on Android-15 and previous.

You don't need to compile it yourself, you can get the compiled libraries from the lib folder and include in your project.
